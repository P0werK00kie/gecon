# Essential Disaster Preparedness Guide for Homeowners

Natural disasters can strike without warning, making preparation crucial for protecting your family and property. At Gecon, we've witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires across the United States. Through our 30+ years of disaster recovery experience, we've learned what makes the difference between a manageable situation and a catastrophic loss.

## Creating Your Emergency Plan

### Family Communication Strategy

Every household needs a clear communication plan that all family members understand:

- **Designate an out-of-state contact** who can serve as a central communication point
- **Establish meeting locations** both near your home and outside your neighborhood
- **Ensure everyone knows important phone numbers** by heart or has them written down
- **Practice your plan regularly** with family drills

### Important Documents

Keep copies of essential documents in a waterproof container:

- Insurance policies (homeowner's, auto, life, health)
- Identification documents (passports, driver's licenses, Social Security cards)
- Financial records (bank statements, credit card information)
- Medical records and prescription information
- Property deeds and rental agreements

## Building Your Emergency Supply Kit

### Basic Supplies (72-Hour Kit)

Your emergency kit should sustain your family for at least three days:

- **Water**: One gallon per person per day
- **Non-perishable food**: Canned goods, energy bars, dried fruits
- **Battery-powered or hand-crank radio**
- **Flashlights and extra batteries**
- **First aid kit** with essential medications
- **Whistle** for signaling help
- **Dust masks and plastic sheeting** for shelter
- **Moist towelettes and garbage bags** for sanitation

### Extended Supplies

For longer-term situations, consider adding:

- Additional water storage and purification tablets
- Camping stove and fuel
- Warm clothing and sturdy shoes
- Tools and supplies for minor repairs
- Cash in small bills
- Fire extinguisher
- Matches in waterproof container

## Protecting Your Property

### Structural Preparations

Regular maintenance can significantly reduce disaster damage:

- **Roof inspection**: Check for loose shingles, damaged flashing, or weak spots
- **Tree maintenance**: Remove dead branches and trees that could fall on your home
- **Drainage systems**: Keep gutters clean and ensure proper water flow away from your foundation
- **Windows and doors**: Install storm shutters or have plywood pre-cut for quick installation

### Insurance Considerations

Review your insurance coverage annually:

- **Understand what's covered** and what requires additional policies
- **Document your belongings** with photos or video
- **Know your deductibles** and how claims are processed
- **Consider flood insurance** even if you're not in a high-risk area

## Technology and Communication

### Emergency Apps and Alerts

Stay informed with reliable sources:

- **Weather apps** with severe weather alerts
- **Emergency management apps** from local authorities
- **Red Cross emergency app** for safety tips and shelter locations
- **FEMA app** for disaster resources and recovery assistance

### Power and Communication Backup

- **Portable phone chargers** and solar chargers
- **Battery-powered or hand-crank radio**
- **Two-way radios** for family communication
- **Generator** (properly installed and maintained)

## Special Considerations

### Pets and Livestock

Don't forget your animals in emergency planning:

- **Identification tags** and microchips up to date
- **Carrier or crate** for each pet
- **Pet supplies** including food, water, medications, and comfort items
- **Evacuation plan** that includes pet-friendly shelters or arrangements

### Elderly and Disabled Family Members

Ensure special needs are addressed:

- **Medical equipment** backup power sources
- **Medication supplies** for extended periods
- **Mobility aids** and backup equipment
- **Caregiver arrangements** and emergency contacts

## After the Storm: Recovery Steps

### Immediate Safety

- **Wait for official all-clear** before venturing outside
- **Check for injuries** and provide first aid
- **Inspect your home** for structural damage before entering
- **Document damage** with photos for insurance claims

### Professional Help

Know when to call professionals:

- **Electrical damage**: Never attempt DIY electrical repairs
- **Structural damage**: Have engineers assess safety
- **Water damage**: Quick action prevents mold and further damage
- **Tree removal**: Large or dangerous trees require professional equipment
